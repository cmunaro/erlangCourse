# My first erlang project

This code was built for my first trip in Erlang for a [course in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-erlang-for-beginners/) after that two my colleagues told me about functional languages.

### How to run:
 - Execute `run.sh`
 - Call the functions exposed by _mybank_ in the erlang shell, (for now) they are:
    - start() **needed to start the otp application**
    - stop()
    - balance(userId)
    - deposit(userId, Amount)
    - withdraw(userId, Amount)
